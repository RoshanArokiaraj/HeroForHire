About

Our game, titled Hero for Hire, is an action-adventure roleplaying game featuring several maps and a simple but integrated story. The game revolves around a wandering hero named Red, who becomes attached to a bunny they see through the window of a pet store. Seeing that the bunny is incredibly expensive, Red applies for various jobs as a “hero for hire”, with their goal being to become rich enough to purchase the bunny.

The educational portion of our gameplay is presented through our gemstones. Throughout the vast map, three gems are scattered, each of which need to be obtained to complete the game. As the game progresses you learn a little bit about the history and the properties of the stones, as well as how they tie into our story, eventually leading to a happy conclusion.
